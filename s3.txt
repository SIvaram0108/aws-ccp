• Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS
• It’s advertised as ”infinitely scaling” storage 
• Many websites use Amazon S3 as a backbone
• Many AWS services use Amazon S3 as an integration as well

Amazon S3 Use cases
• Backup and storage
• Disaster Recovery
• Archive
• Hybrid Cloud storage
• Application hosting
• Media hosting
• Data lakes & big data analytics
• Software delivery
• Static website

Amazon S3 - Buckets
• Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in “buckets” (directories)
• Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
• Buckets are defined at the region level 
• S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
• Naming convention
• No uppercase, No underscore
• 3-63 characters long
• Not an IP
• Must start with lowercase letter or number
• Must NOT start with the prefix xn--
• Must NOT end with the suffix -s3alias

Amazon S3 - Objects
• Objects (files) have a Key
• The key is the FULL path:
• s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
• s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
• The key is composed of prefix + object name
• s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
• There’s no concept of “directories” within buckets
(although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
• Just keys with very long names that contain slashes (“/”)
• Object values are the content of the body:
• Max. Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
• If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”
• Metadata (list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata)
• Tags (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle
• Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

Amazon S3 – Security
• User-Based
• IAM Policies – which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
• Resource-Based
• Bucket Policies – bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
• Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain (can be disabled)
• Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common (can be disabled)
• Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
• The user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
• AND there’s no explicit DENY
• Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

S3 Bucket Policies
• JSON based policies
• Resources: buckets and objects
• Effect: Allow / Deny
• Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
• Principal: The account or user to apply the 
policy to
• Use S3 bucket for policy to:
• Grant public access to the bucket
• Force objects to be encrypted at upload
• Grant access to another account (Cross 
Account)

 If you get a 403 Forbidden error, make sure the bucket 
policy allows public reads!

Amazon S3 -Versioning
• You can version your files in Amazon S3
• It is enabled at the bucket level
• Same key overwrite will change the “version”: 1, 2, 3….
• It is best practice to version your buckets
• Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
• Easy roll back to previous version 
• Notes:
• Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will 
have version “null”
• Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions

Amazon S3 – Replication (CRR & SRR)
• Must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets
• Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
• Same-Region Replication (SRR)
• Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
• Copying is asynchronous
• Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
• Use cases:
• CRR – compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
• SRR – log aggregation, live replication between production and test 
accounts

s3 - pricing 
You pay for all bandwidth into and out of Amazon S3, except for the following:
Data transferred out to the internet for the first 100GB per month, aggregated across all AWS Services and Regions (except China and GovCloud)
Data transferred in from the internet.
Data transferred between S3 buckets in the same AWS Region. 
Data transferred from an Amazon S3 bucket to any AWS service(s) within the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket (including to a different account in the same AWS Region).
Data transferred out to Amazon CloudFront (CloudFront).

You pay for retrieving objects that are stored in S3 Standard – Infrequent Access, S3 One Zone – Infrequent Access, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

For Cross-Region Replication (CRR) and Same-Region Replication (SRR), you pay the S3 charges for storage in the selected destination S3 storage classes, for the primary copy, for replication PUT requests, and for applicable infrequent access storage retrieval charges. For CRR, you also pay for inter-region Data Transfer OUT from S3 to each destination region.
