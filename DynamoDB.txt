DynamoDB 
• Fully Managed Highly available with replication across 3 AZ
• NoSQL database - not a relational database 
• Scales to massive workloads, distributed “serverless” database
• Millions of requests per seconds, trillions of row, 100s of TB of storage
• Fast and consistent in performance 
• Single-digit millisecond latency – low latency retrieval
• Integrated with IAM for security, authorization and administration
• Low cost and auto scaling capabilities
• Standard & Infrequent Access (IA) Table Class

DynamoDB Accelerator - DAX
• Fully Managed in-memory cache for 
DynamoDB
• 10x performance improvement – single- digit millisecond latency to microseconds 
latency – when accessing your DynamoDB 
tables

• Difference with ElastiCache at the CCP 
level: DAX is only used for and is 
integrated with DynamoDB, while 
ElastiCache can be used for other 
databases
