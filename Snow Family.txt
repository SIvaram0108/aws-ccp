Snowball Edge (for data transfers)
• Physical data transport solution: move TBs or PBs of data in or out 
of AWS
• Alternative to moving data over the network (and paying network 
fees)
• Pay per data transfer job
• Provide block storage and Amazon S3-compatible object storage
• Snowball Edge Storage Optimized
• 80 TB of HDD capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object 
storage
• Snowball Edge Compute Optimized 
• 42 TB of HDD or 28TB NVMe capacity for block volume and S3 
compatible object storage
• Use cases: large data cloud migrations, DC decommission, disaster 
recovery

AWS Snowcone & Snowcone SSD
• Small, portable computing, anywhere, rugged & secure, withstands harsh environments
• Light (4.5 pounds, 2.1 kg)
• Device used for edge computing, storage, and data 
transfer
• Snowcone – 8 TB of HDD Storage
• Snowcone SSD – 14 TB of SSD Storage
• Use Snowcone where Snowball does not fit (space- constrained environment)
• Must provide your own battery / cables
• Can be sent back to AWS offline, or connect it to 
internet and use AWS DataSync to send data

AWS Snowmobile
• Transfer exabytes of data (1 EB = 1,000 PB = 1,000,000 TBs)
• Each Snowmobile has 100 PB of capacity (use multiple in parallel)
• High security: temperature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance
• Better than Snowball if you transfer more than 10 PB
