AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)
• Define your cloud infrastructure using a familiar language:
• JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET
• The code is “compiled” into a CloudFormation template (JSON/YAML)
• You can therefore deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together
• Great for Lambda functions
• Great for Docker containers in ECS / EKS
