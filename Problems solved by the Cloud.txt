Problems solved by the Cloud
• Flexibility: change resource types when needed
• Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
• Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or 
adding additional nodes
• Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
• High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
• Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications
