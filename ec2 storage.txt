Elastic Block Store(EBS)
• An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach 
to your instances while they run
• It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
• They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level)
• They are bound to a specific availability zone

EC2 Instance Store
• EBS volumes are network drives with good but “limited” performance
• If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store
• Better I/O performance
• EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they’re stopped (ephemeral)
• Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content 
• Risk of data loss if hardware fails
• Backups and Replication are your responsibility

EFS – Elastic File System
• Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on 100s of EC2
• EFS works with Linux EC2 instances in multi-AZ

EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA)
• Storage class that is cost-optimized for files not 
accessed every day
• Up to 92% lower cost compared to EFS Standard
• EFS will automatically move your files to EFS-IA 
based on the last time they were accessed
