IAM: Users & Groups
• IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service
• Root account created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared
• Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
• Groups only contain users, not other groups
• Users don’t have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

IAM: Permissions
• Users or Groups can be 
assigned JSON documents 
called policies
• These policies define the 
permissions of the users 
• In AWS you apply the least 
privilege principle: don’t give 
more permissions than a user 
needs

IAM – Password Policy
• Strong passwords = higher security for your account
• In AWS, you can setup a password policy:
• Set a minimum password length
• Require specific character types:
• including uppercase letters
• lowercase letters
• numbers
• non-alphanumeric characters
• Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
• Require users to change their password after some time (password expiration)
• Prevent password re-use

IAM Security Tools
• IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
• a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various 
credentials
• IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
• Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those 
services were last accessed.
• You can use this information to revise your policies.

IAM Guidelines & Best Practices
• Don’t use the root account except for AWS account setup
• One physical user = One AWS user
• Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
• Create a strong password policy
• Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
• Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
• Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK)
• Audit permissions of your account using IAM Credentials Report & IAM 
Access Advisor
• Never share IAM users & Access Keys
