AWS Batch
• Fully managed batch processing at any scale
• Efficiently run 100,000s of computing batch jobs on AWS
• A “batch” job is a job with a start and an end (opposed to continuous)
• Batch will dynamically launch EC2 instances or Spot Instances
• AWS Batch provisions the right amount of compute / memory
• You submit or schedule batch jobs and AWS Batch does the rest!
• Batch jobs are defined as Docker images and run on ECS
• Helpful for cost optimizations and focusing less on the infrastructure
