Amazon SQS – Standard Queue
• Oldest AWS offering (over 10 years old)
• Fully managed service (~serverless), use to decouple applications
• Scales from 1 message per second to 10,000s per second
• Default retention of messages: 4 days, maximum of 14 days
• No limit to how many messages can be in the queue
• Messages are deleted after they’re read by consumers
• Low latency (<10 ms on publish and receive)
• Consumers share the work to read messages & scale horizontally
