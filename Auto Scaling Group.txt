What’s an Auto Scaling Group?
• In real-life, the load on your websites and application can change
• In the cloud, you can create and get rid of servers very quickly
• The goal of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to:
• Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load
• Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load
• Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of machines running
• Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
• Replace unhealthy instances
• Cost Savings: only run at an optimal capacity (principle of the cloud)

Auto Scaling Groups – Scaling Strategies
• Manual Scaling: Update the size of an ASG manually
• Dynamic Scaling: Respond to changing demand
• Simple / Step Scaling
• When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%), then add 2 units
• When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%), then remove 1
• Target Tracking Scaling
• Example: I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%
• Scheduled Scaling
• Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns
• Example: increase the min. capacity to 10 at 5 pm on Fridays
• Predictive Scaling
• Uses Machine Learning 
to predict future traffic 
ahead of time
• Automatically 
provisions the right 
number of EC2 
instances in advance
• Useful when your load 
has predictable time- based patterns
