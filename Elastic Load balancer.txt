Why use a load balancer?
• Spread load across multiple downstream instances
• Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application
• Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
• Do regular health checks to your instances
• Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
• High availability across zones

Why use an Elastic Load Balancer?
• An ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) is a managed load balancer
• AWS guarantees that it will be working
• AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
• AWS provides only a few configuration knobs
• It costs less to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot more 
effort on your end (maintenance, integrations)
• 4 kinds of load balancers offered by AWS:
• Application Load Balancer (HTTP / HTTPS only) – Layer 7
• Network Load Balancer (ultra-high performance, allows for TCP) – Layer 4
• Gateway Load Balancer – Layer 3
• Classic Load Balancer (retired in 2023) – Layer 4 & 7
