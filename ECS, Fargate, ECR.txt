ECS 
• ECS = Elastic Container Service
• Launch Docker containers on AWS
• You must provision & maintain the infrastructure (the EC2 instances)
• AWS takes care of starting / stopping containers
• Has integrations with the Application Load Balancer

Fargate
• Launch Docker containers on AWS
• You do not provision the infrastructure (no EC2 instances 
to manage) – simpler!
• Serverless offering
• AWS just runs containers for you based on the CPU / RAM you need

ECR
• Elastic Container Registry
• Private Docker Registry on AWS
• This is where you store your Docker images so they can 
be run by ECS or Fargate
